# Browser.icu Contribution Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Browser.icu contribution guide. This monorepo contains front-end apps using Svelte and Tailwind.

## Getting Started

## Branching & Commits

We follow a consistent git branch prefix convention.

- `feature/` - Used for developing a new feature or enhancement.
- `fix/` - For bug fixes — addressing issues or broken functionality.
- `chore/`- For routine tasks that don’t add features or fix bugs.
- `docs/` - For updating or creating documentation.

> Example: `fix/improved-comparison-section`

Similarly, we suggest following a naming convention for commits.

- `feature(apps/<app_name>):`
- `fix(apps/<app_name>):`
- `chore(apps/<app_name>):`
- `docs(apps/<app_name>):`

> Example: `chore(apps/persona): remove unused (Resources) section`

Where `<app_name>` can be any of the apps inside `browser.icu/apps/`.
